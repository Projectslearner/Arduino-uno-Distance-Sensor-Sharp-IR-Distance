# Arduino-uno-Distance-Sensor-Sharp-IR-Distance
The Arduino Uno Distance Sensor (Sharp IR Distance Sensor) measures distance by emitting infrared light and detecting the reflection. It provides accurate distance readings in various environments, enabling obstacle avoidance, proximity detection, and object tracking in robotics and automation applications.
